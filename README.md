# Free Fall Simulation - ICS4U

This project is intended to replicate an object in free fall using inputs for mass, maximum displacement, and air resistance value.


## Features
This simulation has many key features programmed into it, these include:

- Inputs for mass, maximum displacement, and force of air resistance
- Realtime statistics for scalars and vectors as the object falls
- The option to entirely ignore air resistance
- Velocity-time graph visuallized with Chart.JS

## Important Notes

- Make sure to use the yellow submit button after entering in new values
- Air resistance is disabled by default, make sure to check the checkbox if you want it enabled, then enter a value
